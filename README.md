# Classic vs. Modern Ciphers

This project explores classical and modern cryptography by implementing:

1. *Product Classical Cipher* (Playfair + Rail Fence)
2. *Hybrid Modern Cryptosystem* (RSA + AES/Triple DES)

## Project Structure
```
cryptography_project/
â”œâ”€â”€ task_i/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ task_i.py          # Implementation of Playfair + Rail Fence cipher
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ task_i_output.txt  # Sample outputs for Task I
â”œâ”€â”€ task_ii/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ task_ii.py         # Implementation of RSA + AES hybrid encryption
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ task_ii_output.txt # Sample outputs for Task II
```

## Installation
Ensure Python 3.x is installed, then install dependencies:
bash
pip install pycryptodome


## Usage
Run the respective task scripts:
bash
python task_i/task_i.py
python task_ii/task_ii.py

Follow on-screen prompts for encryption and decryption.
